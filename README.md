# SDC260 Web Development Project

This project repository was completed as part of an HTML coding class at ECPI University. 
Over the course of 5 weeks, I learned how to build and model a website, and this is the end result.

## Installation

In order to install the code and run it on your own device, 
simply download the `index.html` and `stylesheet.css` together into a folder. 
Once downloaded, you can run the HTML with a browser of your choice by opening it. 
Alternatively, you can edit the code with a coding software (I used Visual Studio Code), 
and save your changes to your folder to see the differences.
